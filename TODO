Things I want to do, specific to java:

* wrapper classes for JCE; eventually allowing:
    - runtime substitution of a different crypto library (for embedded)
    - fallback to pure-java crypto if necessary
  this means "javax.crypto" and "java.security"
* fix RSA key generation (i couldn't get this to work!)

Things I didn't port from paramiko (yet?):

* kex-gex aka group-exchange kex
	would require porting the list of primes
* sftp client support (mediumly likely)
* sftp server support (unlikely)
* compression


----------

* aes256-cbc will not work with java's default "crypto policy" files.
  you have to go to:
      http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html
  and download the "unlimited strength" files at the bottom of the page,
  under "other downloads".  THIS IS RETARDED.
  
  
* the transport unit tests are taking a long time.  there may not be any
  simple fix, because it seems to be the crypto that's taking most of the
  time.  some sample snapshots (all times in milliseconds):
     [java] server kex-init = 183; k = 81; hash = 0; sign = 100; msg = 0; send = 0; activate = 2
     [java] server kex-init = 199; k = 55; hash = 0; sign = 78; msg = 0; send = 62; activate = 4
     [java] server kex-init = 819; k = 739; hash = 0; sign = 78; msg = 0; send = 0; activate = 2
     [java] server kex-init = 1074; k = 351; hash = 1; sign = 80; msg = 0; send = 334; activate = 308
     [java] startKex = 351; x = 0; e = 350
     [java] server kex-init = 1072; k = 354; hash = 0; sign = 77; msg = 0; send = 340; activate = 301
