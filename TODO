Things I didn't port from paramiko:

* kex-gex aka group-exchange kex
	would require porting the list of primes
* sftp client/server support

* why is java's RSA key generation broken? :(

* aes256-cbc will not work with java's default "crypto policy" files.
  you have to go to:
      http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html
  and download the "unlimited strength" files at the bottom of the page,
  under "other downloads".  THIS IS RETARDED.
