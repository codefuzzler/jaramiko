Things I want to do, specific to java:

* apparently BaseTransport.detectUnsupportedCiphers() isn't really working.

* let ppl import RSAKey from BigIntegers?
 
* make this programmatically accessible:
  mLog.debug("using kex " + mAgreedKex + "; server key type " + mAgreedServerKey + "; cipher: local " +
                   mAgreedLocalCipher + ", remote " + mAgreedRemoteCipher + "; mac: local " + mAgreedLocalMac +
                   ", remote " + mAgreedRemoteMac);
  -- split cipher names into string(name) and int(bits)
* add ability to WRITE key files too
  
Things I didn't port from paramiko (yet?):

* kex-gex aka group-exchange kex
	would require porting the list of primes
* sftp client support (mediumly likely)
* sftp server support (unlikely)


----------

* unit tests require JCE.  this probably won't change.

* aes256-cbc will not work with java's default "crypto policy" files.
  you have to go to:
      http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html
  and download the "unlimited strength" files at the bottom of the page,
  under "other downloads".  THIS IS RETARDED.
